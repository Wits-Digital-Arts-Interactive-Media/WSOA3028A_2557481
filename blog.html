         <summary><b> Your experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages </b></summary>

            <p>  Setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages was quite an adventure for me. Initially, I found the process <br> to be a bit 
                 complicated, navigating through repositories, and branches, and understanding the version <br> control concepts. 
                 The documentation, though comprehensive, felt overwhelming at times. Figuring out <br> the right repository
                 structure and configuring the settings for GitHub Pages took some trial and error. 
            </p>
            <p>  I encountered challenges while linking my custom domain and configuring the necessary DNS settings.<br>
                 However, I gained valuable insights into the world of version control and web hosting. Despite the <br> initial
                 complexity, the learning experience was invaluable, and I now feel more confident in managing <br> my projects on GitHub 
                 and publishing them using GitHub Pages.

         <summary><b> Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your experience with the internet today </b></summary>

            <p>  "The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges presents a fascinating reflection on the nature of <br> knowledge and the search 
                 for meaning in an infinite and seemingly chaotic universe of information. <br> In many ways, this story resonates with our 
                 contemporary experience of the internet. The internet, like <br> Borges' library, is a vast repository of information, 
                 offering a multitude of perspectives, ideas, and data. <br> We navigate through this digital labyrinth in search of knowledge,
                 much like the inhabitants of Borges' <br> library. 
            </p>
            <p>  However, just as in the story, our quest for meaning on the internet can sometimes feel overwhelming <br> and futile. The 
                 sheer volume of information, much of it unfiltered and unorganized, can lead to a sense <br> of being lost in the vastness 
                 of data. Additionally, the challenge of discerning credible sources from <br> misinformation mirrors the inhabitants'
                 struggle to find meaningful books amidst the infinite possibilities <br> in Borges' library.
            </p>
            <p>  Moreover, the story touches on the human desire for order and pattern recognition in the face of apparent <br> chaos. 
                 In our digital age, we develop tools like search engines and algorithms to impose order on the <br> internet's vastness, 
                 attempting to find coherence and meaning. Yet, much like the inhabitants of Borges' <br> library, we often grapple with 
                 the realization that not all questions have clear answers and that understanding <br> everything may be an unattainable goal.
            </p>
            <p>  In essence, "The Library of Babel" provides a thought-provoking lens through which to consider our <br> relationship with
                 the internet, prompting us to reflect on the challenges, opportunities, and inherent complexity <br> of navigating the 
                 boundless sea of information in our digital age.

         <summary><b> Interesting things you have found about the history of the web </b></summary>

            <p>  The late 1990s saw the dot-com boom, characterized by the rapid growth of internet-based companies. Many <br> startups 
                 emerged during this period, leading to both innovation and speculation, ultimately resulting in the <br> dot-com bubble 
                 burst in 2000.
            </p>
            <p>  Platforms like Friendster, MySpace, and later Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn played a significant role in <br> shaping 
                 the social aspect of the web. Social media transformed how people connect, share, and communicate <br> online.
            </p>
            <p>  With the widespread use of smartphones, the mobile web has become increasingly important. Responsive web <br> design, 
                 introduced around 2010, allowed websites to adapt to different screen sizes, optimizing the user <br> experience on 
                 various devices.

         <summary><b> My goals for this course </b></summary>

            <p>  Entering the Interactive Media module, I'm buzzing with excitement about all the cool stuff I'm going to learn! <br> My main
                 aim for this course is to dive deep into UI/UX design because I'm super keen on creating interfaces <br> that people enjoy
                 using. And, learning HTML, C++, and Java sounds extremely interesting! 
            </p>
            <p> My goal here is not just to get the technical
                know-how but to understand how design and code work together to <br> make killer interactive  experiences. By the end of it
                all, I want to be able to whip up websites and apps that people <br> love to use and keep  coming back to.

            <p>  
              The Museo del Prado's website showcases some of Spain's best fine art, with paintings spanning the entire <br> screen
              in enough detail to reveal the textures of the brush strokes. It's as if you're right up against the artwork <br> while 
              watching it. Another feature I like is how each background image adjusts to the shape of the viewport.

              The Frans Hals Museum exhibits both modern and 16th and 17th century art, including works by Frans Hals, <br> a portrait 
              artist.Its website is possibly my favorite, with a perfect balance of animation, usability, color, and <br> subtle nuances 
              on each page. I adore the elaborate scroll effects, as well as the sticky sidebar that follows you <br> as you scroll, 
              ensuring that you always have access to the most crucial links.
