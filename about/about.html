            <p>
                I'm a passionate explorer with an insatiable curiosity for the world around me. Whether it's hiking through breathtaking 
                landscapes or trying to find my way around a foreign country, I find solace and inspiration in 
                the beauty of nature and different cultures. Alongside my adventurous spirit, I have a deep appreciation for the arts, 
                such as the masterpieces of Van Gogh and Monet that evoke profound emotions and stir the imagination. I find joy in bringing laughter and 
                positivity, delighting in the ability to uplift spirits and forge meaningful
                connections. And when it comes to competition, I thrive on the exhilarating rush of victory, channeling determination and strategy 
                to emerge triumphant in any endeavor (it's a blessing and a curse).

            <summary style="color: rgba(130,141,130,255);"><b>My goals</b></summary>
            <p>
                Motivated by a pursuit of excellence, my career aspirations are anchored in the desire to contribute to esteemed 
                organisations such as Avalanche Studios, renowned for their groundbreaking contributions to the gaming industry. With a 
                meticulous focus on aesthetic refinement and user-centric design principles, my goal is to develop  interfaces 
                that seamlessly integrate with captivating gameplay, enriching a player's journey and fostering unforgettable experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love travelling and my biggest fear is to have an office job where I don't enjoy what I do, thus I hope to work remotely and 
                get opportunities to work all around the world. Whether collaborating with 
                international teams or immersing myself in different environments, my aim is to cultivate a global network of colleagues and 
                collaborators, drawing inspiration from the rich tapestry of perspectives and experiences that our world has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In pursuit of academic and professional excellence, I would love to pursue a Ph.D., delving into the depths of interactive 
                design theory and pushing the boundaries of knowledge within the field. I envision myself contributing to the academic discourse while simultaneously applying my insights to 
                real-world projects. Through this approach, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, ultimately redefining the 
                future of interactive entertainment with innovation and expertise.
