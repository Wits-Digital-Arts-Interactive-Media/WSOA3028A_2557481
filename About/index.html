            <h2><b>Good ol' personal details</b></h2>
            <p>
                I'm a passionate explorer with an insatiable curiosity for the world around me. Whether it's hiking through breathtaking 
                landscapes or trying to find my way around a foreign country, I find solace and inspiration in 
                the beauty of nature and different cultures. Alongside my adventurous spirit, I have a deep appreciation for the arts, 
                such as the masterpieces of Van Gogh and Monet that evoke profound emotions and stir the imagination. I find joy in bringing laughter and 
                positivity, delighting in the ability to uplift spirits and forge meaningful
                connections. And when it comes to competition, I thrive on the exhilarating rush of victory, channeling determination and strategy 
                to emerge triumphant in any endeavor (it's a blessing and a curse).
            </p>

            <h2><b>My goals</b></h2>
            <p>
                Motivated by a pursuit of excellence, my career aspirations are anchored in the desire to contribute to esteemed 
                organisations such as Avalanche Studios, renowned for their groundbreaking contributions to the gaming industry. With a 
                meticulous focus on aesthetic refinement and user-centric design principles, my goal is to develop  interfaces 
                that seamlessly integrate with captivating gameplay, enriching a player's journey and fostering unforgettable experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love travelling and my biggest fear is to have an office job where I don't enjoy what I do, thus I hope to work remotely and 
                get opportunities to work all around the world. Whether collaborating with 
                international teams or immersing myself in different environments, my aim is to cultivate a global network of colleagues and 
                collaborators, drawing inspiration from the rich tapestry of perspectives and experiences that our world has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In pursuit of academic and professional excellence, I would love to pursue a Ph.D., delving into the depths of interactive 
                design theory and pushing the boundaries of knowledge within the field. I envision myself contributing to the academic discourse while simultaneously applying my insights to 
                real-world projects. Through this approach, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, ultimately redefining the 
                future of interactive entertainment with innovation and expertise.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a deep-seated passion for general knowledge and trivia, relishing the 
                opportunity to delve into diverse subjects and uncover fascinating facts. Whether engaging in spirited debates over historical 
                events or exploring the latest scientific discoveries, I find immense joy in expanding my understanding of the world around me. 
                This curiosity fuels my competitive spirit, driving me to continuously seek new challenges and opportunities for intellectual 
                growth. Embracing both the thrill of competition and the quest for knowledge, I strive to bring a well-rounded perspective to 
                every endeavor, enriching my interactions and contributions within the global community.

                So, just for fun, here's a random fun fact.
