            I have already started syncing my wireframe's colour palette to that of my website's - As seen in the images below, I want to use 
            earthy tones to create a sense of warmth in my website. As well as incorporate pictures of artworks from various artists that I like.

            Just like the artworks everywhere in my website, do I want my user experience to be an artwork itself. When users use it, it should

            my work and look at my designs.

            On the Home page, the design effectively leverages modern web design techniques such as flexbox and parallax scrolling to create 
            a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The main design, along with the blog and about me buttons, are neatly tucked 
            underneath each other to enhance readability and accessibility. This arrangement ensures that users can easily navigate the site 
            without feeling overwhelmed by cluttered elements.

            The Blogs Page features a streamlined navigation bar, with elements tucked underneath each other for a clean and organized look. 
            The blog image buttons are also arranged underneath each other, providing a coherent and easily navigable layout. A scroll-up button 
            remains available, recognizing the extensive content length and improving user experience by allowing quick navigation to the top of 
            the page.

            On the Blog Post Page, the navigation bar is neatly tucked in, and the text is made smaller to fit within the design framework 
            without compromising readability. The main buttons are positioned above the title, ensuring they are still clearly visible and 
            accessible, thereby maintaining a user-friendly interface.

            The Designs Page adopts a compact navigation approach with the navigation tucked in and the text size reduced for better

          <p class="main-text">
            Looking at my user flow diagram, you can see that users have access to every main page in my website. Having a navigation bar at 
            the top of a website is a fundamental UI and UX choice that significantly enhances user experience and flow. Primarily, it provides 
            users with immediate access to essential sections or pages of the website, allowing for effortless navigation. With the navigation bar
            consistently positioned at the top, users can quickly orient themselves and understand the structure of the site, reducing confusion 
            and frustration. This enhances usability, especially for first-time visitors who may not be familiar with the website's layout.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Moreover, a fixed navigation bar ensures that users can easily move between pages or sections without having to scroll back to the 
            top, saving time and effort. This seamless navigation experience contributes to a positive overall user experience, increasing 
            engagement and satisfaction with the website. Additionally, a well-designed navigation bar with clear labels and intuitive placement 
            fosters a sense of trust and credibility, as users perceive the website as organized and user-friendly. Therefore, incorporating a 
            navigation bar at the top of the website is not only a good practice but also a critical element in optimizing UI and UX design.

        <h2 class="sub-title"><b>My Style Guide</b></h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          The style guide for my website is meticulously designed to evoke a sense of classiness and formality while ensuring accessibility and 
          aesthetic appeal. The primary font used throughout the site is Bodoni MT, chosen for its elegant and timeless appearance. This font, 
          consistently applied at a 25px size, maintains readability across all pages, reinforcing a coherent and professional look. The color 
          scheme features a dark grey background contrasted with light beige font color, creating a subtle yet effective contrast that enhances 
          readability without straining the eyes. Additionally, colors derived from the artwork featured on the website are selectively 
          incorporated, seamlessly blending the site's elements and artwork for a cohesive visual experience.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          The use of large artworks by various impressionist artists aims to mimic the atmosphere of a museum, with the website serving as a 
          guide. This approach not only showcases the beauty of the art but also provides a calming and visually rich experience for users. 
          The neutral color palette, seen in the photographs and artwork, contributes to a serene and inviting ambiance, promoting a sense of 
          tranquility and focus. By integrating these elements, the website offers a visually pleasing environment that encourages users to 
          explore and engage with the content without feeling overwhelmed or distracted.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          The consistency in design elements, such as font choice, color palette, and layout, significantly enhances the website's effectiveness 
          and accessibility. The readability of Bodoni MT at 25px ensures that all text is easily legible, while the dark grey background and 
          light beige font provide optimal contrast, adhering to accessibility standards. This thoughtful design consideration ensures that users 
          with visual impairments or reading difficulties can navigate and consume the content comfortably. The incorporation of colors from the 
          featured artwork not only ties the visual elements together but also maintains a harmonious and aesthetically pleasing experience.
        </p>
        <p class="main-text">
          Furthermore, the strategic placement of the navigation bar at the top of each page ensures that users can easily access different 
          sections of the site, enhancing the overall user experience. The inclusion of a smooth scroll-up button adds to the site's navigational 
          efficiency, allowing users to return to the top of the page effortlessly. The large images, central to the museum-like experience, 
          are not only visually engaging but also help in creating a clear and structured layout. This design choice, combined with the neutral 
          and calming color palette, ensures that the website is both functional and inviting, providing users with a seamless and enjoyable 
          browsing experience.

            Similarly, employing colours such as grey and beige on my website contributes to its visual appeal and user experience. 
            Grey is often chosen for its neutral and versatile nature, serving as a backdrop that allows other colours and elements to 
            stand out while providing a sense of sophistication and elegance. Beige, on the other hand, evokes feelings of warmth and
            tranquility, creating a welcoming atmosphere that encourages user engagement and exploration. Together, these colours
            creates a harmonious and balanced colour palette that conveys professionalism and professionalism to my website.

          <p class="main-text">
            If it has not been clear to users, I enjoy art and museums. Thus, looking at my moodboard you can see that I want to incorporate
            as much of a <i>renaissance</i> or <i>baroque</i> feel to my website as possible. I want the paintings in my website to seem like
            are hanging like paintings on a museum wall. Creating the sense that the user is in a museum of my own making.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            I want to incorporate a way in my website that when a user hovers their cursor over the painting it gives a short sentence or description
            of the painting name, and where I was when I took it.
