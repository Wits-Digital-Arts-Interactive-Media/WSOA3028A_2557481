      <h3> My Goal Alignment </h3>
      <p>   
        I want my website to serve as both a visual and interactive CV, as well as a tool to show people who I am 
        and what I have to offer. As a result, it should be just as artistic as my personality. I can accomplish this 
        by using various colour combinations that correspond to different themes and images. I will also achieve this by presenting 
        my many portfolio pieces, which will be divided into areas such as the art pieces I've created, the 
        games I've developed, and my 'side hustles'. As much as I want to be vivid and personal, I will 
        make it professional but entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want the user to see several aspects of myself in order to understand my adaptability. This will be evident not 
        just in my portfolio work, but also in my blog articles, academic essays, and other forms of study that I considered 
        relevant to the foundation of this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've previously stated, I want my website to also serve as my resume. I want it to display rather than tell. I'll 
        start by adding various photographs with descriptions of what community initiatives I've been involved in, job 
        shadowing and work experience, and a little "about me" part that will describe my life story and how I came to this 
        point in life.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3><b>Reflection</b></h3>
      <p>   
        Creating a website is both an exhilarating and challenging endeavor, marked by a rollercoaster of experiences and 
        emotions. Initially, delving into HTML I felt like navigating through a maze of tags and elements, with each line 
        of code representing a new puzzle to solve. Learning the ropes was daunting, especially when faced with the 
        intricacies of syntax and structure. Yet, with perseverance and patience, the pieces started to fall into place, and 
        the language became a canvas for creativity.
      </p>     
      <p>   
        Despite the initial hurdles, there was a certain thrill in crafting each element of the webpage, from headers to 
        paragraphs, and seeing them come together to form a cohesive layout. The process of refining and designing the 
        webpage is where the magic happens. Experimenting with colors, fonts, and layouts transforms the once-static code 
        into a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing interface. It was a journey of trial and error, where every tweak brought the 
        design closer to perfection.
      </p> 
      <p>   
        However, the journey was not without its frustrations. Transitioning from HTML to JavaScript introduced a new layer
        of complexity, as the focus shifts from structure to behaviour. Integrating JavaScript functionality into the website 
        was challenging, with syntax errors and logic bugs lurking at every turn. It felt overwhelming and I was lost 
        in a sea of curly brackets and semicolons.
      </p> 
      <p>   
        Yet, amidst the confusion and setbacks, there's a sense of satisfaction that comes from overcoming obstacles and 
        making things work. The "Aha!" moment when the code finally behaves as intended is immensely rewarding, making all 
        the effort worthwhile. It's a reminder of the power of perseverance and the joy of creative problem-solving.
      </p> 
      <p>   
        In the end, creating a website was more than just writing code; it was a journey of self-discovery and growth. It's 
        about pushing boundaries, embracing challenges, and celebrating victories, big and small. And while the road may be 
        winding and arduous, the destination—a fully functional and beautifully designed website—is worth every moment of the 
        journey.
