                <p>   
                    I want my website to serve as both a visual and interactive CV, as well as a tool to show people who I am 
                    and what I have to offer. As a result, it should be just as artistic as my personality. I can accomplish this 
                    by using various colour combinations that correspond to different themes and images. I will also achieve this by presenting 
                    my many portfolio pieces, which will be divided into areas such as the art pieces I've created, the 
                    games I've developed, and my 'side hustles'. As much as I want to be vivid and personal, I will 
                    make it professional but entertaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want the user to see several aspects of myself in order to understand my adaptability. This will be evident not 
                    just in my portfolio work, but also in my blog articles, academic essays, and other forms of study that I considered 
                    relevant to the foundation of this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I've previously stated, I want my website to also serve as my resume. I want it to display rather than tell. I'll 
                    start by adding various photographs with descriptions of what community initiatives I've been involved in, job 
                    shadowing and work experience, and a little "about me" part that will describe my life story and how I came to this 
                    point in life.
                </p>

            <h3 style="color: rgba(130,141,130,255);"><b>Reflection</b></h3>
                <p>   
                    Creating a website is both an exhilarating and challenging endeavor, marked by a rollercoaster of experiences and 
                    emotions. Initially, delving into HTML I felt like navigating through a maze of tags and elements, with each line 
                    of code representing a new puzzle to solve. Learning the ropes was daunting, especially when faced with the 
                    intricacies of syntax and structure. Yet, with perseverance and patience, the pieces started to fall into place, and 
                    the language became a canvas for creativity.
                </p>     
                <p>   
                    Despite the initial hurdles, there was a certain thrill in crafting each element of the webpage, from headers to 
                    paragraphs, and seeing them come together to form a cohesive layout. The process of refining and designing the 
                    webpage is where the magic happens. Experimenting with colors, fonts, and layouts transforms the once-static code 
                    into a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing interface. It was a journey of trial and error, where every tweak brought the 
                    design closer to perfection.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    However, the journey was not without its frustrations. Transitioning from HTML to JavaScript introduced a new layer
                    of complexity, as the focus shifts from structure to behaviour. Integrating JavaScript functionality into the website 
                    was challenging, with syntax errors and logic bugs lurking at every turn. It felt overwhelming and I was lost 
                    in a sea of curly brackets and semicolons.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    Yet, amidst the confusion and setbacks, there's a sense of satisfaction that comes from overcoming obstacles and 
                    making things work. The "Aha!" moment when the code finally behaves as intended is immensely rewarding, making all 
                    the effort worthwhile. It's a reminder of the power of perseverance and the joy of creative problem-solving.
                </p> 
                <p>   
                    In the end, creating a website was more than just writing code; it was a journey of self-discovery and growth. It's 
                    about pushing boundaries, embracing challenges, and celebrating victories, big and small. And while the road may be 
                    winding and arduous, the destination—a fully functional and beautifully designed website—is worth every moment of the 
                    journey.
