                <p>   
                    I want my website to serve as both a visual and interactive CV, as well as a tool to show people who I am 
                    and what I have to offer. As a result, it should be just as artistic as my personality. I can accomplish this 
                    by using various colour combinations that correspond to different themes and images. I will also achieve this by presenting 
                    my many portfolio pieces, which will be divided into areas such as the art pieces I've created, the 
                    games I've developed, and my 'side hustles'. As much as I want to be vivid and personal, I will 
                    make it professional but entertaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want the user to see several aspects of myself in order to understand my adaptability. This will be evident not 
                    just in my portfolio work, but also in my blog articles, academic essays, and other forms of study that I considered 
                    relevant to the foundation of this site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I've previously stated, I want my website to also serve as my resume. I want it to display rather than tell. I'll 
                    start by adding various photographs with descriptions of what community initiatives I've been involved in, job 
                    shadowing and work experience, and a little "about me" part that will describe my life story and how I came to this 
                    point in life.
                </p>
