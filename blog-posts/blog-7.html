            <h3><b>Navigation Issues</b></h3>
                <p>   
                    The intricacies of the JavaScript navigation systems proved to be a formidable challenge in the development of my 
                    website. Despite my efforts, I encountered persistent issues, likely stemming from my folder structure, which impeded the 
                    seamless functionality of the navigation system. Unfortunately, when the index page appeared to function correctly, subsequent 
                    pages faltered, and vice versa. Frustration mounted as I struggled with this inconsistency, realising the pressing need for 
                    a solution.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recognising the urgency of the situation, I decided to implement a temporary fix by incorporating buttons to facilitate 
                    navigation. This "fix" ensured that the website remained operational and accessible for assessment purposes. 
                    However, the underlying issue persisted, prompting me to seek further assistance. In light of this, I am committed to 
                    scheduling a consultation with one of the tutors to delve deeper into the complexities of my JavaScript navigation and resolve 
                    the folder structure issues. Through collaboration and guidance, I am confident that I will overcome these 
                    challenges and better the functionality of my website.
                </p>

            <br>
            <h3><b>JavaScript</b></h3>
                <p>      
                    The navigation.js code defines an array named navLinks containing objects representing navigation links for my website. The 
                    'createNavigationBar()' function dynamically generates a navigation bar based on the navLinks array, creating list items and 
                    anchor elements for each link. These elements are then appended to a 'nav' element in the HTML document. Finally, the function 
                    is called when the DOM content is fully loaded, ensuring the navigation bar is created dynamically after the HTML content 
                    is parsed.
                </p>

                <p>    
                    The colour-palette.js code offers functionality to dynamically change and reset the background colour of my webpage. 
                    Initially, it defines a constant originalColor storing the original background colour. Two functions, changeBackgroundColour() 
                    and resetBackgroundColour(), are then introduced. The former selects a random colour from an array of predefined colour values 
                    and sets it as the background colour of the document body. Conversely, the latter restores the original background colour by 
                    assigning the originalColour value to the document body's background colour style property. This code enables the implementation 
                    of an interactive feature where users can experience a variety of background colours by clicking a button, while also having 
                    the option to revert to the default background colour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The quote.js code defines an array called quotes, containing several famous quotes from iconic movies. The 
                    generateQuote() function is created to randomly select one of these quotes and display it on my webpage. Within the function, 
                    a random index is generated based on the length of the quotes array, ensuring that it falls within the bounds of the array's 
                    indices. The selected quote is then retrieved from the quotes array using the random index and assigned as the text content 
                    of an HTML element with the ID "quote", effectively updating the displayed quote each time the function is invoked. This code 
                    snippet enables the creation of a simple quote generator feature that adds an element of randomness and entertainment to my
                    webpage, potentially enhancing user engagement and interaction.

            <h3><b>Future Fixes</b></h3>
                <p>   
                    As I review my website, I remain aware of several areas requiring refinement. Among these, my navigation system stands 
                    out as a priority, particularly its visibility and colour scheme. The navigation system's accessibility is compromised by its 
                    inconsistent visibility across pages, creating usability challenges for users. Additionally, the colour scheme employed for 
                    my navigation does not adhere to ethical web design principles, as it fails to ensure easy readability for all users. 
                    While acknowledging these shortcomings, I am committed to addressing them proactively. In an upcoming CSS assignment, I intend 
                    to implement changes to enhance the navigation system's accessibility and visual appeal, aligning it more closely with ethical 
                    design standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, I am actively engaged in experimentation to address the navigation system's shortcomings on my website's index page. 
                    Recognising the importance of a seamless navigation experience for users, I am exploring alternative solutions within a 
                    separate file. This approach allows me to isolate the issue and experiment with different strategies to improve the navigation 
                    system's functionality and user-friendliness. By dedicating time and effort to this experimentation process, I am confident in
                    my ability to identify and implement effective solutions that enhance the overall user experience of my website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, I have noticed on my deployed page the button that takes users to the next blog post is sometimes working, and sometimes 
                    not.. It works fine when I debug it in visual studios, so I'll need to book a consultation with a tutor for that as well.
