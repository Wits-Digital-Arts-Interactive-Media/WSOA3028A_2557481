      <h3><b>What changes have you had to make to your website to incorporate JavaScript?</b></h3>
      <p>
        In tweaking my website with JavaScript, I made some updates to improve how users interact with it. First off, I added AJAX 
        requests to fetch and display fun facts from an external API. This means when users opens my website and goes to the About Me page, they 
        get a fresh fact instantly without reloading the whole page. It’s like having a trivia nugget ready, which 
        makes browsing more fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also added JavaScript to help me spice up my image gallery, 
        when users click on a country button, it loads up relevant travel photos right there on the spot. It’s all about creating a smooth, 
        interactive journey where users can explore freely and discover content effortlessly.

        By integrating JavaScript, I streamlined how users navigate and interact with my website. It’s not just about adding flashy effects 
        (though those are fun too), but more about making everything intuitive and responsive. Whether it’s loading dynamic content or 
        validating user inputs, JavaScript made it possible to handle these tasks smoothly without making users wait. This kind of 
        responsiveness not only enhances user satisfaction but also encourages them to explore more deeply. It’s like having a virtual tour 
        guide.

      <h3><b>Reflection on Verdi (2020), The Road to Technocolonialism</b></h3>
      <p>
        Verdi (2020) outlines the prevailing asymmetrical duopoly in AI technology between the United States and China, attributing their 
        dominance to strategic national policies, the presence of influential multinational corporations, economies of scale driven by vast 
        data accumulation, robust research ecosystems, and significant geopolitical influence. This duopoly poses challenges for other nations 
        aiming to compete in AI development and raises concerns about concentrated power in the hands of a few major players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on Verdi’s points, it’s evident that the US and China’s proactive national strategies and investment in AI have positioned 
        them as leaders. Their emphasis on cultivating domestic champions like GAFAMI and BATX not only drives innovation but also consolidates 
        their economic and technological power globally. The reliance on vast data sets further enhances their AI capabilities, creating a 
        formidable advantage that smaller and developing countries struggle to match.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implications for developing countries are profound. Automation and AI advancements threaten job stability, particularly in 
        labor-intensive sectors, potentially exacerbating socio-economic disparities. Moreover, dependency on AI superpowers may compromise 
        digital sovereignty and perpetuate techno-colonial dynamics, where access to critical technologies hinges on political and economic 
        concessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To counteract these challenges, developing countries must prioritize building indigenous AI capabilities, safeguarding data privacy, 
        fostering international cooperation, promoting ethical AI practices, and empowering local communities through education and inclusive 
        governance. These strategies can mitigate the risks of techno-colonialism and ensure that AI technologies contribute to inclusive growth 
        and sustainable development worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        In navigating the evolving AI landscape, it’s crucial for nations to strike a balance between harnessing technological advancements and 
        safeguarding against potential inequalities and dependencies. By adopting a strategic and collaborative approach, countries can shape a 
        future where AI serves the interests of all societies, promoting equitable access and sustainable development globally.
