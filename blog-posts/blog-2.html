            <h3 style="color: rgba(130,141,130,255);"><b>My Folder Structure</b></h3>
                <p>The reason for my unconventional folder structure in my website stems from the experimental nature of 
                  its development. Initially, as I worked on creating the website, I engaged in a process of trial and error, 
                  exploring different layouts and arrangements. However, as I began organising my pages into folders, I encountered 
                  difficulties with the navigation between the various pages. Despite attempts to rectify the issue, the flow of the 
                  website was disrupted. Consequently, I reverted back to the original folder structure to ensure the website's 
                  functionality and navigation. Currently, the website comprises a single "Images" folder alongside ten 
                  individual pages, including "about," "blog-1" through "blog-4," "blogs," "designs," "essays," "index," and "portfolio." 
                  This structure, although unconventional, maintains the website's operational integrity while providing access to its content.

            <h3 style="color: rgba(130,141,130,255);"><b>My URL scheme</b></h3>
                <p>The URL scheme for my website, accessible at "https://wits-digital-arts-interactive-media.github.io/WSOA3028A_2557481/",
                   serves as the digital gateway to my online presence. This URL showcases my endeavors in the worl of 
                   interactive media, providing a platform for my creative pursuits, projects, and thoughts.
                 </p>
                 <p>It serves as a virtual roadmap, guiding visitors through my work. 
                   Rooted in the domain of Wits Digital Arts Interactive Media, the URL reflects a collaborative endeavor within a
                   digital community.

            <h3 style="color: rgba(130,141,130,255);"><b>My wireframe ideas</b></h3>
                <p>
                  A good wireframe serves as the blueprint for a website, outlining its structure, layout, and functionality in a 
                  simplified manner. It accomplishes several key objectives, including providing a clear visualisation of the site's 
                  content hierarchy, navigation flow, and user interaction pathways. By focusing on the fundamental elements without
                  distractions such as colors or images, a wireframe allows designers and stakeholders to concentrate on the core 
                  features and user experience. This approach fosters efficient communication, enabling early feedback and iteration 
                  to refine the design before moving into the development phase. Moreover, a website with ample negative space and 
                  predominantly image-based content offers a visually engaging and intuitive user experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  My strategy of using negative space allows for better readability, clearer focus on key elements, and enhanced user 
                  comprehension. My images, when used effectively, can convey information quickly and evoke emotions, enriching the overall 
                  user experience. By prioritising such design principles, I aim to create a website that not only captivates users
                  visually but also guides them seamlessly through content and interactions, ultimately enhancing their satisfaction and engagement.

                <p>  
                  The Museo del Prado's website showcases some of Spain's best fine art, with paintings spanning the entire screen
                  in enough detail to reveal the textures of the brush strokes. It's as if you're right up against the artwork while 
                  watching it. Another feature I like is how each background image adjusts to the shape of the viewport.

                <p>  
                  The Frans Hals Museum exhibits both modern and 16th and 17th century art, including works by Frans Hals, a portrait 
                  artist.Its website is possibly my favorite, with a perfect balance of animation, usability, color, and subtle nuances 
                  on each page. I adore the elaborate scroll effects, as well as the sticky sidebar that follows you as you scroll, 
                  ensuring that you always have access to the most crucial links.
