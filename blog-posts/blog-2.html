                <summary><b>My Folder Structure</b></summary>
                <p>The reason for my unconventional folder structure in my website stems from the experimental nature of 
                  its development. Initially, as I worked on creating the website, I engaged in a process of trial and error, 
                  exploring different layouts and arrangements. However, as I began organising my pages into folders, I encountered 
                  difficulties with the navigation between the various pages. Despite attempts to rectify the issue, the flow of the 
                  website was disrupted. Consequently, I reverted back to the original folder structure to ensure the website's 
                  functionality and navigation. Currently, the website comprises a single "Images" folder alongside ten 
                  individual pages, including "about," "blog-1" through "blog-4," "blogs," "designs," "essays," "index," and "portfolio." 
                  This structure, although unconventional, maintains the website's operational integrity while providing access to its content.

                <p>  
                  The Museo del Prado's website showcases some of Spain's best fine art, with paintings spanning the entire <br> screen
                  in enough detail to reveal the textures of the brush strokes. It's as if you're right up against the artwork <br> while 
                  watching it. Another feature I like is how each background image adjusts to the shape of the viewport.

                <p>  
                  The Frans Hals Museum exhibits both modern and 16th and 17th century art, including works by Frans Hals, <br> a portrait 
                  artist.Its website is possibly my favorite, with a perfect balance of animation, usability, color, and <br> subtle nuances 
                  on each page. I adore the elaborate scroll effects, as well as the sticky sidebar that follows you <br> as you scroll, 
                  ensuring that you always have access to the most crucial links.
