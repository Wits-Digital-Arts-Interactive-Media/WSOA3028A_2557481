                intelligence and big data by Lutz (2019)</b></h3>
                <p>   
                    Lutz delves into the multidimensional concept of digital inequalities, which encompass discrepancies in access to the 
                    internet, variations in digital skills and technology usage, and disparities in the outcomes derived from internet 
                    utilisation. These divides, collectively termed the first, second, and third-level digital divides, offer a comprehensive 
                    framework for understanding the complex interplay between socio-economic factors and digital technology adoption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first-level digital divide primarily concerns unequal access to the internet, elucidating disparities observed across
                     demographic groups such as race and gender. While strides have been made in closing access gaps in developed nations like 
                     the United States, global discrepancies persist, echoing broader economic inequalities. The second-level digital divide 
                     shifts focus to disparities in digital proficiency and utilisation, revealing nuanced inequalities along socio-economic 
                     lines. This segment highlights how factors such as age, education, and gender influence individuals' engagement with digital 
                     technologies, with younger, educated, and male users often exhibiting higher levels of skill and usage frequency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third-level digital divide explores discrepancies in the outcomes and benefits derived from internet usage, acknowledging 
                    that even when access and skill levels are comparable, certain groups may leverage digital tools more effectively to attain 
                    favourable offline outcomes. Here, age emerges as a significant predictor, albeit with inconclusive directionality, 
                    underscoring the complex interplay of demographic characteristics and digital outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, the discussion extends to the implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and big 
                    data on digital inequalities. These technologies have the potential to exacerbate existing disparities by perpetuating unequal
                     access, skill acquisition, and outcomes. For instance, individuals lacking access to quality education or residing in 
                     underserved areas may face barriers in acquiring the requisite skills to harness AI and big data effectively. Additionally, 
                     biases embedded within AI algorithms and disparities in data accessibility can further deepen digital inequalities, posing 
                     challenges to the realization of an inclusive digital society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, the reading underscores the multifaceted nature of digital inequalities and their implications for 
                    socio-economic outcomes. By examining the nuances of access, skills, and outcomes, as well as the impact of emerging 
                    technologies, the author provides valuable insights into the complexities of digital inclusion and the imperative of 
                    addressing these disparities to foster a more equitable digital landscape.

                <h3 style="color: rgba(130,141,130,255);font-size: 1.5em;"><b>My Thoughts on Assignment 3</b></h3>
                    <p>   
                        Working on assignment 3, where I finally got to dive into CSS, was an incredibly fun experience. It felt like I was 
                        adding the finishing touches to my website, bringing it to life with features that not only made it functional but also 
                        aesthetically pleasing. However, it wasn't without its challenges. Keeping the designs consistent across different pages 
                        proved to be a bit overwhelming at times, and small details like getting alignments just right often took longer than 
                        expected. But overcoming these hurdles felt incredibly rewarding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One aspect I particularly enjoyed was working on the button images and icons to enhance the user experience. Adding 
                        visually appealing buttons not only made the website more inviting but also made navigation more intuitive. Incorporating 
                        icons to navigate between blog posts added a touch of sophistication while streamlining the user journey. Additionally, 
                        implementing 'back to top' buttons for larger pages proved to be a game-changer in terms of user interface. It provided 
                        users with a convenient way to navigate back to the top of the page, enhancing overall usability.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The navigation system was another area where CSS truly shone. Moving away from plain blue links to a more visually 
                        appealing navigation bar was a welcome change. It not only improved the aesthetics of the website but also made it 
                        easier for users to find their way around. Having a well-organised and visually appealing navigation system not only 
                        improves user experience but also reflects positively on the overall design of the website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, while working with CSS presented its fair share of challenges, it was an immensely rewarding experience. 
                        Seeing my website come alive with CSS styles and features was incredibly satisfying, and it motivated me to continue 
                        refining and improving my web design skills.
                    </p>
