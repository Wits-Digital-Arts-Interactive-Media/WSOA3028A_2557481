        <h2><b>My wireframe ideas refined</b></h2>
        <p>
            I have already started syncing my wireframe's colour palette to that of my website's - As seen in the images below, I want to use 
            earthy tones to create a sense of warmth in my website. As well as incorporate pictures of artworks from various artists that I like.
        </p>
        <p>
            The images will be able to be used as buttons and I want the paragraphs that explains images, websites, diagrams to be at the one side 
            of the screen giving the user a left-to-right reading expersience and keeping everything together. The navigation bar with be seen 
            constantly by the user to enhance the user interface flow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like the artworks everywhere in my website, do I want my user experience to be an artwork itself. When users use it, it should 
            create a sense of calm and invoke different emotions. I want people to appreciate my favoutrite artworks with me, as well as easily 
            read my work and look at my designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also go read more about the artworks that was used in my website in the 'About Me' section of my website.

        <h2><b>My User Flow Diagram</b></h2>
        <p>
            Looking at my user flow diagram, you can see that users have access to every main page in my website. Having a navigation bar at 
            the top of a website is a fundamental UI and UX choice that significantly enhances user experience and flow. Primarily, it provides 
            users with immediate access to essential sections or pages of the website, allowing for effortless navigation. With the navigation bar
            consistently positioned at the top, users can quickly orient themselves and understand the structure of the site, reducing confusion 
            and frustration. This enhances usability, especially for first-time visitors who may not be familiar with the website's layout. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, a fixed navigation bar ensures that users can easily move between pages or sections without having to scroll back to the 
            top, saving time and effort. This seamless navigation experience contributes to a positive overall user experience, increasing 
            engagement and satisfaction with the website. Additionally, a well-designed navigation bar with clear labels and intuitive placement 
            fosters a sense of trust and credibility, as users perceive the website as organized and user-friendly. Therefore, incorporating a 
            navigation bar at the top of the website is not only a good practice but also a critical element in optimizing UI and UX design.

        <h2><b>My Colour Palette</b></h2>
        <p>
            Similarly, employing colours such as grey and beige on my website contributes to its visual appeal and user experience. 
            Grey is often chosen for its neutral and versatile nature, serving as a backdrop that allows other colours and elements to 
            stand out while providing a sense of sophistication and elegance. Beige, on the other hand, evokes feelings of warmth and
            tranquility, creating a welcoming atmosphere that encourages user engagement and exploration. Together, these colours
            creates a harmonious and balanced colour palette that conveys professionalism and professionalism to my website.

        <h2><b>My Moodboard</b></h2>
        <p>
            I it has not been clear to users, I enjoy art and museums. Thus, looking at my moodboard you can see that I want to encorporate
            as much of a <i>renaissance</i> or <i>baroque</i> feel to my website as possible. I want the paintings in my website to seem like
            are hanging like paintings on a museum wall. Creating the sense that the user is in a museum of my own making. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to incorporate a way in my website that when a user hovers their cursor over the paiting it give a short sentence or description
            of the painting name, and where I was when I took it.
